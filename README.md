# Chess-in-Godot
Building chess from the ground up in Godot engine.  No assets are in this repository.

1)  The local "hotseat" basic gameplay which is only playable on a single device.  When complete, this version will be uploaded to itch.io. I might make a youtube tutorial covering several details of the project, to help the rest of the Godot community.


2)  A version which has some form of computer AI controlled opponent.  There are existing frameworks for this, but no effort has yet been done to determine how easy they will be to adapt to the project.  I may also decide to just do it myself "for fun".
When complete, the above mentioned itch.io upload will be updated with the ability to play against an AI opponent.  There will not be a tutorial made for this portion.
