# Chess-in-Godot
Building chess from the ground up in Godot engine.  No assets are in this repository.

[Video from before castling was implemented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9aj2qnCr_I)


Fully implemented castling, check and checkmate notifications, pawn conversion, with drag and drop behavior for the pieces.

Feel free to use for whatever purposes you would like.

While this project is not fully finished and still has some bugs remaining, I will no longer update it.
