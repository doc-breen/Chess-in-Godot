# Chess-in-Godot
Building chess from the ground up in Godot engine.  No assets are in this repository.

This project contains 3 major parts.  The first 2 parts are intended to be web uploads only, playable in a browser with a mouse or any touch-screen device.


1)  The local "hotseat" basic gameplay which is only playable on a single device.  When complete, this version will be uploaded to itch.io. I also intend to make a youtube tutorial covering several details of the project at this point, to help the rest of the Godot community.


2)  A version which has some form of computer AI controlled opponent.  There are existing frameworks for this, but no effort has yet been done to determine how easy they will be to adapt to the project.  I may also decide to just do it myself "for fun".
When complete, the above mentioned itch.io upload will be updated with the ability to play against an AI opponent.  There will not be a tutorial made for this portion.


3)  Upon completion of the first 2 phases, the project will be forked into a private repository for the purposes of completing the networking code and modifying the game to include some non-traditional chess mechanics.  The 3rd phase of the project is intended to be released on Steam when completed.
